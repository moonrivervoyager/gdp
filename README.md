Codecademy GDP Age Project
📊 Analyzing the Relationship Between GDP and Life Expectancy (2000-2015)
🔹 Overview
This project examines the relationship between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy from 2000 to 2015 using data from the World Bank and World Health Organization. By visualizing trends over time and analyzing correlations, this study aims to determine whether economic growth directly leads to increased life expectancy.

📌 Key Findings & Insights
1️⃣ GDP and Life Expectancy Generally Increase Over Time
✅ Countries with higher GDP (e.g., USA, Germany, China) tend to have higher life expectancy.
✅ Developing nations, like Zimbabwe and China, show rapid growth in both GDP and life expectancy, suggesting improvements in healthcare, infrastructure, and economic stability.
✅ However, the rate of increase varies across countries, and some countries experience stronger growth in one metric than the other.

2️⃣ Weak-to-Moderate Correlation (0.34) Between GDP & Life Expectancy
🔹 A correlation heatmap revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.34 between GDP and life expectancy, indicating a weak to moderate relationship:

GDP alone does not fully determine life expectancy.
Countries with similar GDP levels may have very different life expectancy outcomes due to healthcare access, government policies, inequality, and education.
The United States has very high GDP but slower life expectancy growth, suggesting economic strength does not always translate to public health improvements.
3️⃣ Scatter Plot Revealed Outliers & Trends
✅ A scatter plot with a regression line confirmed that higher GDP is generally associated with longer life expectancy, but there are significant outliers:

China shows strong GDP growth but a slower increase in life expectancy, indicating economic growth may not immediately translate into health improvements.
Zimbabwe’s life expectancy rises significantly despite low GDP, suggesting targeted health interventions can lead to major improvements even without strong economic growth.
Some wealthy nations (e.g., USA) show a plateau in life expectancy, potentially due to healthcare inefficiencies, lifestyle factors, or inequality.
📊 Data Visualization Techniques Used
To uncover these insights, we used:
✅ Dual-Axis Line Charts → Tracked GDP & Life Expectancy trends over time.
✅ Correlation Heatmap → Measured how strongly GDP and Life Expectancy are related.
✅ Scatter Plot + Regression Line → Identified general trends and outliers.
✅ Violin Plot (optional) → Explored the distribution of life expectancy across countries.

🚀 Conclusion & Next Steps
📌 While GDP plays a role in life expectancy, it is not the sole determinant.
📌 Other socio-economic factors such as healthcare access, inequality, and public policies must be considered.
📌 Further analysis could include examining education levels, healthcare expenditures, and government stability to better understand what truly drives life expectancy improvements.

This study highlights the importance of looking beyond economic growth when evaluating a country's overall well-being.
